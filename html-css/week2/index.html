        <h3>web development as an industry</h3>
        <p>
          Examples of dramatic transformation in communication and commerce led
          by web development include e-commerce. Online auction sites such as
          eBay have changed the way consumers find and purchase goods and
          services. Online retailers such as Amazon.com and Buy.com (among many
          others) have transformed the shopping and bargain-hunting experience
          for many consumers.

        <h3>practical web development</h3>
        <p>
          Since the comercialization of the web, web development has been a
          growing industry. The growth of this industry is being driven by
          businesses wishing to use their website to sell products and services
          to customers. There is an open software for web development like
          BerkeleyDB, GlassFish, LAMP(Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack and
          Perl/Plack. This has kept the cost of learning web development to a
          minimum. Another contributing factor to the growth of the industry has
          been the rise of easy-to-use WYSIWYG web-development software, such as
          Adobe Dreamweaver, BlueGriffon and Visual Studio. Knowledge of
          HyperTextMarkup Language(HTML) or of programming languages is still
          required to use such software, but the basics can be learned and
          implemented quickly with the help of help files, technical books,
          internet tutorials or face-to-face training. An ever-growing set of
          tools and technologies have halped developers build more dynamic and
          active websites. Further, web developers now help to deliver
          applications as web services which were traditionally only available
          as applications on a desk-based computer. This has allowed for many
          opportuinities to decentralize information and media distribution.
          Examples can be seen with the rise of cloud services such as Adobe
          Creative Cloud, Dropbox and GoogleDocs. These web services allows
          users to interact with application from many locations, instead of
          being tied to a specific workstation for their application
          environment.
